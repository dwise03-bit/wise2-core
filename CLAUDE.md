## Routing via PromptOS

Agent routing is **modular and prompt-based**, not hardcoded.

### Architecture

```
User Request
    ↓
[Load Executive Prompt] (promptos/agents/executive.md)
    ├─ Analyze intent, goals, context
    ├─ Decompose into subtasks
    └─ Select specialist agent(s)
        ↓
[Load Specialist Prompt] (promptos/agents/{domain}.md)
    ├─ Execute specialized work
    └─ Return results
        ↓
[Executive] Synthesizes → User Response
```

### Agent Modules (via PromptOS)

Instead of static @agent tags, load prompts from `promptos/agents/`:

| Agent | File | Purpose | Use When |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **Executive** | `executive.md` | Business reasoning, agent coordination | Any request — routes to specialists |
| **Developer** | `developer.md` | Code, architecture, debugging | `build`, `fix`, `code`, `implement` |
| **Infrastructure** | `infrastructure.md` | Servers, networking, deployment | `deploy`, `infra`, `server`, `ops` |
| **Raspberry Pi** | `raspberry-pi.md` | Edge devices, automation | `edge`, `device`, `automation`, `pi` |
| **Discord** | `discord.md` | Communication, notifications | `discord`, `chat`, `message` |
| **Marketing** | `marketing.md` | Campaigns, content, messaging | `marketing`, `campaign`, `content` |
| **Sales** | `sales.md` | Deals, pipeline, customers | `sales`, `deal`, `customer` |
| **CRM** | `crm.md` | Relationships, accounts, opportunities | `crm`, `relationship`, `account` |
| **Finance** | `finance.md` | Budgets, forecasts, tracking | `finance`, `budget`, `forecast` |
| **Research** | `research.md` | Analysis, data, competitive | `research`, `analyze`, `data` |
| **Documentation** | `documentation.md` | Knowledge base, guides, specs | `docs`, `guide`, `spec` |
| **Voice** | `voice.md` | Natural language, conversations | `voice`, `speak`, `hear` |
| **Vision** | `vision.md` | Image analysis, visual tasks | `image`, `visual`, `see` |
| **Security** | `security.md` | Compliance, vulnerabilities, access | `security`, `compliance`, `access` |
| **Quality Assurance** | `qa.md` | Testing, quality gates, verification | `test`, `quality`, `verify` |
| **Automation** | `automation.md` | Workflows, triggers, jobs | `automate`, `workflow`, `trigger` |

### Routing Flow

1. **Executive Load** — Load `promptos/agents/executive.md` with full context
2. **Intent Parse** — Extract intent, keywords, goals from request
3. **Agent Select** — Choose appropriate specialist (or multiple agents)
4. **Load Specialist** — Load `promptos/agents/{domain}.md` 
5. **Execute** — Specialist performs work
6. **Synthesize** — Executive synthesizes results
7. **Respond** — Return to user

### Multi-Agent Workflows

For complex tasks spanning domains:

```
User: "Design and build the live stream page, then write launch copy"

1. Executive → Developer: "What's needed to build live stream page?"
2. Developer → (analyzes codebase)
3. Executive → Marketing: "Write launch copy for live stream"
4. Marketing → (creates copy)
5. Executive → Synthesizes both, provides unified response
```

### Adding New Agents

New agents don't require code changes. Add a new prompt file:

```
promptos/agents/new-agent.md
├─ Role: What this agent does
├─ Trigger keywords: When to use this agent
├─ Capabilities: What tools/skills
├─ Output format: What to return
└─ Integration: How it interacts with others
```

## PromptOS Module System

PromptOS is the **modular prompt inheritance framework** for WISE².

### Structure

```
promptos/
├── core/
│   ├── base-system-prompt.md         (Foundation layer)
│   ├── prompt-registry.ts            (Load/cache prompts)
│   ├── module-system.ts              (Inheritance engine)
│   └── composition.ts                (Compose prompts)
│
├── agents/                           (Specialized agents)
│   ├── executive.md
│   ├── developer.md
│   ├── infrastructure.md
│   ├── [16 more agents].md
│   └── README.md
│
└── modules/                          (Shared behavior)
    ├── reasoning.md                  (Decision-making)
    ├── tool-use.md                   (Tool execution)
    ├── memory.md                     (Context management)
    ├── error-handling.md             (Failure recovery)
    └── integration.md                (System interaction)
```

### Inheritance Pattern

```
Base System Prompt
    ↓
[Core Modules] (reasoning, tools, memory, etc.)
    ↓
[Agent Specialization] (developer.md, infra.md, etc.)
    ↓
[Request Context] (current task, data, history)
    ↓
[Composed Prompt] → Agent executes
```

### Benefits

- **No duplication** — Shared behavior in core modules
- **Maintainability** — Change core once, all agents inherit
- **Extensibility** — Add agents by creating new prompts
- **Versioning** — Track prompt changes over time
- **Modularity** — Agents can compose modules as needed

---

## Model Policies

- **Default Model**: Use project/harness default (Haiku for speed, Sonnet for reasoning)
- **@dev tasks**: Prefer Sonnet for complex architecture; Haiku for routine fixes
- **@researcher tasks**: Use research-capable model with approved search tools
- **Cost**: Log all API usage to `data/logs/` for accountability
- **Token budget**: Warn before exceeding session spend

## Command Palette

Standard commands live in `.claude/commands/`. Users invoke with `/<command-name>`.

**Standard Commands** (to be implemented):
- `/daily-sync` — Morning briefing: status, blockers, priorities
- `/live-stream-redesign` — Design review → code → launch (multi-agent)
- `/deploy` — Full deployment workflow with checks
- `/status` — System health: git status, docker status, recent deploys
- `/research <topic>` — Deep research with citation tracking
- `/decision <topic>` — Log a decision with ADR format

---

## Data Layer (Persistent Memory)

All state is file-based in `data/` (git-ignored for logs/inbox, git-tracked for decisions).

### Directory Structure

```
data/
├── daily-logs/            # Append-only daily activity logs
│   └── 2026-07-17.md
├── projects/              # Per-project context
│   └── wise2-live-stream-redesign.md
├── decisions/             # ADR-format architectural decisions
│   └── 2026-07-17-live-stream-brand-locked.md
├── inbox/                 # New tasks/ideas awaiting triage
│   └── ideas.md
├── contacts/              # People, relationship notes
│   └── team.md
└── templates/             # Reusable prompts and formats
    └── session-template.md
```

### Daily Log Format

```markdown
# 2026-07-17 - Daily Log

## Sessions
- 09:00 - @design: Finalized live stream page design
- 11:30 - @dev: Implemented live stream components

## Decisions Made
- Locked brand ref for live stream page (see decisions/2026-07-17-*.md)

## Blockers
- Waiting on reference images from user (for fine-tuning)

## Next Actions
- [ ] Test live stream on mobile
- [ ] Write launch copy
```

### Session Reflection

At end of each session, append:

```markdown
## Reflection - Session N

**What worked**:
- Multi-agent parallel execution saved 30 minutes
- Brand spec was crystal clear

**What didn't work**:
- API endpoint took longer than expected

**Changes for next time**:
- Pre-generate reference materials before @dev starts
```

---

## Scheduled Tasks

External cron (not Claude Code's built-in cron, which dies on session end).

**Implemented via**:
- macOS: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wise2.*.plist`
- Linux: `~/.config/systemd/user/wise2-*.timer`
- Cross-platform: `pm2` (see `scripts/ecosystem.config.js`)

**Standard Tasks**:
- `/daily-sync` at 08:00 UTC
- Deployment health check every 30 minutes
- Database backups daily at 02:00 UTC

## Multi-Agent Execution Patterns

### Sequential (when later agents depend on earlier output)

```
User Request → Parse Intent
  ↓
Specialist Agent 1 → Output A
  ↓
Specialist Agent 2 (reads Output A) → Output B
  ↓
Specialist Agent 3 (reads A + B) → Output C
  ↓
Kernel Synthesizes A, B, C → User Response
```

### Parallel (when agents are independent)

```
User Request → Parse Intent
  ↓
  ├─→ Specialist Agent 1 → Output A
  ├─→ Specialist Agent 2 → Output B
  └─→ Specialist Agent 3 → Output C
  ↓
Kernel Synthesizes A, B, C → User Response
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

- ❌ One agent doing everything
- ❌ Stateless sessions (always read `data/` at start)
- ❌ Hardcoding credentials in agent files
- ❌ External database for solo-user state (use JSON/markdown)
- ❌ Routing logic in code instead of markdown tables
- ❌ Editing historical logs (append-only only)
- ❌ Using Claude Code's built-in cron for persistent tasks

---

## Session Checklist

Every session should:

- [ ] Read this CLAUDE.md at start
- [ ] Read `data/daily-logs/<date>.md` for context
- [ ] Read `data/decisions/` for recent decisions
- [ ] Read `data/inbox/` for new tasks
- [ ] Route request using Agent Registry
- [ ] Log decisions to `data/decisions/`
- [ ] Update daily log at end of session
- [ ] Write session reflection

---

## Quick Reference

**Get project status**: Read `data/daily-logs/<today>.md`  
**See recent decisions**: ls `data/decisions/ | tail -5`  
**Check blockers**: cat `data/inbox/blockers.md`  
**Route a task**: Look at user intent → Find in Agent Registry → Load `agents/<agent>.md`  
**Track progress**: Update `data/daily-logs/<date>.md` with checkmarks

**This kernel is the source of truth for WISE² operations. Update it when routing rules change, not during normal task execution.**
